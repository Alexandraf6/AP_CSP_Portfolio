# Alexandra Flores - Assignment: Practice 01-Binary Numbers - Sept 12,2024
  In this assignment I was able to answer 7/7 questions correctly. Though many people could have had trouble with the many numbers. These 0's and 1's might be a bit challenging to turn to decimals and a small calculation error could lead to someones answer being wrong. When converting binary into decimals or decimals into binary you should make sure to chekc your work and asure that your calculations are correct.
