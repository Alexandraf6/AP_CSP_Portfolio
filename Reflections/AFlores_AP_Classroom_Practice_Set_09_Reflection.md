### The figure below represents a network of physically linked computers labeled A through G. A line between two computers indicates that the computers can communicate directly with each other. Any information sent between two computers that are not directly connected must go through at least one other computer. For example, information can be sent directly between computers A and B, but information sent between computers A and C must go through other computers.

A diagram of a network is shown. The letters A through G are shown, each in a circle. A is in the lower left. B is to the right of A, and connected to it by a straight line. C is to the right and up from B, and connected to it by a straight line. D is to the right and up from C, and it is connected to C by a straight line and to B by a curved line that goes around C from below. E is to the left and down from D, directly above B. E is connected to D, C, and A by straight lines. F is to the right of E, above and to the left of A. F is connected to E and A by straight lines. G is to the right and up from F, directly above A and to the left of D. G is connected to F and D by straight lines.

Which of the following statements about security in the network is true?

l. Computers A and D need to communicate with at least two additional computers in the network in order to communicate with each other.

ll. Computers B and C can communicate with each other without additional computers being aware of the communication.

When asnwering this question I originally answered l and ll but after seeing and maping out the paths from a to d we can see that there is a path with only one computer in between meaning ll is wrong. So the correct answer is B) ll only.
