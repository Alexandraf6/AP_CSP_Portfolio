### Which of the following can be represented by a single binary digit?
A) The position of the minute hand of a clock
B) The remainder when dividing a whole number by 2
C) The value of a Boolean variable
D) The volume of a car radio

When I originally answered this question I answered A) he position of the minute hand of a clock and B)
The remainder when dividing a whole number by 2, a is wrong because time on a clock can be more than just two digits. The remainder of dividing the whole number by 2 is right because this is one of the ways to actually turn a number into binary and the boolean variable is a variable that can only hold to values, true or false. So for this question B and C were correct.
