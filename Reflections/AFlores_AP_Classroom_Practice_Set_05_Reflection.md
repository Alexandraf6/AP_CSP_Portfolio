# Alexandra- 2024-2025 Practice Set 5 -Intellectual Property
### An author is considering publishing an e-book using a Creative Commons license. In which of the following situations would it be better for the author to use a Creative Commons license instead of a traditional copyright?

l)The author wants to make the e-book available as a free download.

ll) The author wants to prevent people from sharing copies of the e-book on peer-to-peer networks.

lll) The author wants to allow people permission to use and modify the e-book.

When originally answering this question I answered a)l only (The author wants to make the e-book available as a free download.) however with creative commons the public has access and the author is able to conrtol if the public can modify their work.
