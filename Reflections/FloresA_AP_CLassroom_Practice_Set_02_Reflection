# Alexandra Flores- Assignment 05: AP Classroom Practice 02-Overflow and Roundoff Errors
### Which of the following scenarios best describes a roundoff error?
When I was answering this question I had originally answered D)I (A program attempts to add two very large positive numbers it produces a negative result because the number of bits required to store the result exceeeds the maximum number of bits avaliable), II ( A program attempts to divide two integers that result in a repeating decimal, but it is unable to store the exact value because an unlimited number of bits are not available) ,III (A program does not have enough bits available to store a floating point number to the required level of precision). I had chosen this answer because I confused what qualified a overflow error and roundoff error. The correct answer to the question was c) II and III only.
