# Alexandra - 2024 - 2025 Practice Set 10 - Parallel and Distributed Computing
### A certain computer has two identical processors that are able to run in parallel. The table below indicates the amount of time it takes each processor to execute each of two processes. Assume that neither process is dependent on the other.

Process	
Execution Time on Either Processor

P 30 seconds
Q	45 seconds

Which of the following best approximates the difference in execution time between running the two processes in parallel instead of running them one after the other on a single processor?

When asnwering this you have to add the seconds of P and Q together which gives 75 to represents you doing it one after the other in one processor and then subtract 45, which is the amount of time it takes for you to process both of these parallel, this will give you 30 seconds as the answer which is B).
