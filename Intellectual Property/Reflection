In this project we were asked to make a form of media, being a presentation, poster ,song, video, informing others about intellectual property. I choose making a poster in canva,
this was because I thought it might be a way to start practicing creating something to inform others. This project also helped me understand more about about how intellectual
property works and this will overall help me in the future in terms of tech and computer science. The process of my online postr would be reasearching to make sure it meets the
requirements for the project, then I started adding everything to my poster. I made sure everything was orgaanized and somewhat visual appeling so people are encouraged to read 
my poster. In addition I added a bit of information to some parts at times when I thought I should add more information. Looking back something I would have done diffrently is 
doing this much earlier, I think it was genuenly a very enjoyable project and I had fun learning about intellectual property. If I did have to develop this further I would 
probobly add some more detailed examples of piracy and plagerism.
