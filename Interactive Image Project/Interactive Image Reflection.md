## Interactive Image Reflection
  In this project we were asked to make an interactive image using mouse events. I choose to make a video game inspired interactive image. In this picture I created a bear with a
crown. I added a settings menu with mouse press so you can chage the color of the sky to imitate day and night. I made it so when you hover your mouse over a circlular sword 
button stars start to appear and surroind the bear, a small circle under the bear and a label showin what it does also appears. When this circle is clicked the bear will take
of its crown and offer its crown up. In addition I made a function that when you chose between pink and yellow it'll change the color. I decided to make this image because I 
was inspired from my emoji project, although I did have to remake my bear. This overall showed me how much I improved with Python and it helped me remeber how use all these
functions and it allowed me to learn how to troubleshoot by myself as I didnt ask for help with this project. Some of the challenges I encountered is that there were times when 
I was making the mouse events where when I attemted to run my image and the page would stop being responsive. I was able to fix this though with some minor adjustments. I did 
develop my picture over the week but when I did work on I was able to get a lot done. I was able to make the bear all at the same time. Then I was able to make the next vision 
of the bear and after I was adding all the mouse events and I finally made tiny adjustments to fix any mistakes I made. My initial idea however wasnt this complicated at first
it was just going to be the sword event where when I clicked the sword icon the bear gave up the crown, I added more because I was given a paper where it showed more clearly 
what the requiremnts were so I had to add more. I didnt recieve any feedback but to keep on working on my project and how my project was getting together nicely.Looking back 
I dont think I wouldve done anything diffrently I like how my picture came out and I dont think there was anything I couldve added that couldve make my picture feel 
overwhelming, in addition I did this all in time and didnt really stuggle with my picture that much. Something I would like to learn to do in the future if its posible is to 
see if I can make it more like a video game somehow and change the screens view to move around the picture.
