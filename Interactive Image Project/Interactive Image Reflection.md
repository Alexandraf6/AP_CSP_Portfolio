## Interactive Image Reflection
  In this project we were asked to make an interactive image using mouse events. I choose to make a video game inspired interactive image. In this picture I created a bear with a
crown. I added a settings menu with mouse press so you can change the color of the sky to imitate day and night. I made it so when you hover your mouse over a circlular sword 
button, stars start to appear and surround the bear, a small circle under the bear and a label showing what it does also appears. When this circle is clicked the bear will take
of its crown and offer its crown up. In addition I made a function that when you chose between pink and yellow it'll change the color of a flower. I decided to make this image
because I was inspired from my emoji project, although I did have to remake my bear. This overall showed me how much I improved with Python and it helped me remember how use all 
these functions.It alsoe allowed me to learn how to troubleshoot by myself as I didnt ask for help with this project. Some of the challenges I encountered is that there were 
times when I was making the mouse events where when I attempted to run my image and the page would stop being responsive.I was able to fix this though with some minor adjustments.
I did develop my picture over the week but when I did work on I was able to get a lot done. I was able to make the bear all at the same time. Then I was able to make the next 
vision of the bear. The next time I was able to work on it I was able to add all the mouse events and I finally made tiny adjustments to fix any mistakes I made. My initial idea
however wasn't this complicated at first it was just going to be the sword event where when I clicked the sword icon the bear gave up the crown, I added more because I was given 
a paper where it showed more clearly what the requiremnts were so I had to add more. I didnt recieve any feedback but to keep on working on my project and how my project was 
getting together nicely.Looking back I dont think I wouldve done anything diffrently I like how my picture came out and I dont think there was anything I couldve added that 
couldve not make my picture feel overwhelming. Plus I was able to do this all in time and didnt really stuggle with my picture that much. Something I would like to learn to do 
in the future if its posible is to see if I can make it more like a video game somehow and change the screens view to move around the picture.
