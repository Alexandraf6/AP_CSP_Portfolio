In this project we were required to make an emoji that represent us. The emoji I made was moslty based on one of my keychains, 
in addition it's in one of my favorite colors. This project helped me improve my coding skills and showed me a bit more of what 
can be accomplished with code. Some skills that I was able to gain while doing this project were patience and problem solving. 
During this project I had some problems making the polygons that were in the bears crown, finding the coordinates that made the 
polygons look lightly tilted was a bit difficult. I was able to work over this problem and was even able to memorize most of 
the codes and their uses. My plan for my emoji in the beginning was to make a bear with a crown having multiple stars 
surrounding it. The end product was slightly diffrent from the starting plan because I thought stars didnt match the emoji I 
was envisioning.  I didnt have any problems inbetween trouble shooting outside of the polygon, these problems didnt last lon as 
I was able to do a little math and it made finding the coordinates more easier. If I had to do this project again I probably 
wouldn't have made any changes and would instead just expiriment with the crown a bit more. If I were to further devolop this 
emoji I would add a bit more details, this would mostly be for the crown. Something I dont know how to do in the present moment 
that wouldve made this project a bit more easier is a triangle code if there is one, this could've made rotating and making the 
crown more easier.
